# E.T. Phone Home, What in the hell is wrong with my phone?

Some time around mid-2020 I noticed something off about a cell phone I had. It was sluggish and jumpy. Over the course of about 4 years things became odder. This is not so much a [search]() not so much into the who or why but 
the how that I've been on since noticing it. It seems like others have had similar issues around me: things like massive amounts of spam, connectivity issues, fast draining battery, people around you seem to know things you had said to others on the phone, can seem visiibile offended if you intentionally send something rude about them over the phone to someone else while they were in the room.

There are many dark alley ways and late nights in extremely odd situations this has led me down but in the spirit of clairity: I do not think it is aliens, government conspiracy, really not sure what to think other than well... it happens. so without further ado what I've seen so far in terms of the phone.

## Probably unrelated but noteworthy
around 2017 I noticed my machine had domain prefix(or was it suffix?) of `utopia.net` while checking why my  wifi kept dropping out on me. With a little further investigation I saw that if I flushed the DNS cache not only would my wifi become stable but the `utopia.net` would go away only to come back and have issues with my wifi again. 

So I continue  like a mad man speeding through the issue wanting to get it resolved. With little initially coming up in my googling, duck duck going, yahooing, and very little snoozing.  I called the ISP and they said there's nothing wrong you're crazy. 

I had found and seen a few posts here and there were people thought it may be some kind of DNS poisoning and they had experienced this as well along I believe but this may have come latter found a crypto trading platform called you utopia.net when I check the laptop to the woman I was living with at the time and a p2p connection seemed to be running.

eventually things settled and I just stayed hardwired in not and eventually moved. Never to see this direct issue again

## The move, a One Plus, and one must question what it means to be paranoid vs resonible suspicion
I had started a new position at a new company when things as well as moved with the woman I was staying with at the time into a 
nice little townhome. Here things with the phone come in. It seemed like everyone when I was working remote knew what I was doing all the time as well as when I signed off for the day what I was doing at home. Admittedly they denyed me any rights to install software on my work laptop and would then be put to the task of accomplishing things that required those priviledges.

Enter: Choco
My way around this scenario was  to use the choco package manager on windows and install the terraform binary when I did all of the sudden all the IoT applicance and printer and pretty much anything touching bluetooth stops and drops. When it all came back up the printer that was both off and offline(albeit still plugged in), begain spitting out three I guess what were supposed to be
offensive print offs. Odd.

So at a certain point I begin creating feedback loops by doing things like typing into microsoft teams but not hitting enter, given that I was on a corporate network of corse I try and get a hold of the cybersecurity team. They seem to think it was humorous so I figured it was probably just them pentesting and having a little fun. Harmless right? Well no something is still off, at a point this gets so bad people aren't hidding it. I no longer have to press enter to send a teams message, I just have to type  and they obviously can see what I have in the message box unsent, and respond.... yeah....

Well this spreads into my personal life as well. Somehow my family knows what's going on at work and I not only live away but don't speak with them that frequently. I'm a little shocked my mom even knows what SharePoint is and even more shocked I'm the only one in I.T. blocked from accessing it.

The story goes on but that's not necessarily what I'm putting this up for but rather this:

## Observations
- when redirecting from a voip number the line is always busy
- Everyone around me have an insane fear of bluetooth, take a look at the device and you'll see some interesting .dll files in them and anything they are around visibily paired or not on or off.
- My microsoft azure active directory at that time had been hijacked and forced me into an MDM, and kind of kerberoasting I suppose.
- Someone  or something has full remote control of about any digital device I come in contact with for a length of time, using ephemeral instances seem to cut down on the number of times odd things happen which leds me to three possible theories at first:
    - This is happening due to multiple parties, some more ahead in the tech curve in others and wouldn't understand what I meant when I type ephemeral up there.
    - It's some sort of worm and it takes a while to prolifirate through.
    - I'm f***ing nuts.
- well after spliting up with that woman I was living with she out of anger admitted I wasn't nuts and after driving myself nuts looking for answers have noticed people will become frightened or deeply angered by the subject.
- strangers knowing my name and me not knowing them.
- people telling me you're not nuts but its okay just chill out
- my phone will switch teleproviders depending which Meta account I'm signed into.
- I write poetry on my phone sometimes, the phone will edit it for me when I'm not there and honestly it's a pretty damn good editor. the catch is it knows things it probably shouldn't if it were a stranger and aboved mentioned ex of 6 years wasn't a techie.
- All i all the impact that was apparent to me was only bad in situations I put myself in to make them bad but the overarching question of has there been a privacy violation and the fact that if there was to let it go unaddressed would mean someone else could find there self in a similar situation with no way to defend themselves against it which isn't a great feeling even with a technical background. Imagin someone being able to alter your communications and you not knowing to make sure and have a way to defend your self with timestamps, encryption finger prints, etc.
- It's like a 4 year episode of Blackmirror only I'm living in it.
