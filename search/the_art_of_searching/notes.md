# The Art of Searching Notes

## From Question To Query

### Thoughts and Acknoledgements

- expresses as searching and the filter narrows down an
  increase in spam hits will rise. Due to money made from advertisments and pre-modern SEO tactics to get higher indexing scores.
- results in bunk information
- results in duplicate information or colliding result hits

- what if your target was a spam cite or didn't have the ecommerce `.com` mantra he mentions? This wouldn't necessarially be the complete opposite =>
  - Shipping malware: take a 302 redirect towards a malicious download link, it could sit with any domain so long as the one a typical user would see is cheap.
  - the results you want to avoid will most _certainly_ have the domain you are looking for.

## Long Term Search

### Thoughts and Ideas

- Brief overview of "long term search" and mentions topical domain knowledge and time expectations, not enough input to see if its one of his stenographies or just an easy way to put it to words.

#### Long term searching: rules and advice

- brainstorm a timeboxed period for preliminary keywords you need.
- synecdochical searching method" refine your query as you search. i.e. the query is dynamic and as you search is shaped by it's results.

- concepts: what I think i would call filters or operators so far at least. Like the set notation of your query's language of love.
- He expresses uniqueness in open world search, I've often thought of this too but in the opposite way. I often catch myself finding something unique on what results show up that I didn't want to filterdown to take the hair nots out will combing my initial queries return:

think; `query 1` goes right and process `query 2` and left for `query 3` does both in parallel then join onto `set 4`. like a serverless pipeline.

- express the idea of spam hits being tied to target hits are by nature made that way so by grabbing spam you see tied to a certaiin `concept` the spam result it's could be a `concept`.

- statements: things like titles, chapters, date, author, all carry different weights on what will be pulled into the black hole of what you read at the end of your querry. Be warry of this just as being aware of how much data you will sift through

- He expresses using TDD in searching

- combing the deep web: The goal is to find as many resources as possible related to the specific question

- compare with personal peramiters: dout authoritative views, i.e. your more like to hit fox, cnn, msnbc propoganda shit piles of info so if you go with the common denominator as your stoping place you may have well have just stopped and watched the local news and joined the common denominator.

  - a sub point: if we are doing this we are typically looking for something outside the realm of conventional knowledge. It's likely then the lesser searched pages or data is what you are looking for and will take more data or complexity to comb through to find.

- **Exercise** Find a result on google and without google entirely try to find the same result. Once you've gone a few cycles increase the `vagueness`, and `volumn` of the target and its relatives and decrease detail, depth making it wider with less connection to its `concepts` directly.

- one I just recently started practicing: Run you querys while searching in different languages. As an english speaker you have the advantage of it being more unique in another language while having an english translated co-hort member if not sibling.

- version every change. he says: _"Systematic record keeping is **OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE** when searching"_

  - so here what he's `"gitting"` at(see what I did there) is to version your work and document qualities for each version. Following SEMVAR and a Conventional Commits like practice I almost wonder if you could employ git as a powerful tool here and have your "searches" be kicked off from a service principal on a pipeline environment rather than you, giving you a version to reference, a commit message that's meaningful and tagged for that quality you wanted to give attribute to, and the outcome of your toil which has hopefully lessend by this effort.

- _How do you Know if your search is/was effective? Check your mistakes_
  - you don't and you wont
  - dude don't forget what regions you're searching over in a distributed network you're gonna have dynamic indicies.
  - chin up high, towards the sky, look death in the eye and remember Nullius in verba lifes about what you look for in it not what it tells you.

## Quick Searching Tips

## Thoughts and Ideas

    - in spirit of back to basics never forget to change
        the language but mentioned above never forget we
        are in a cloud computing era now and many things
        have been converted or are convertable. This is
        separate from the fact you now are querrying the
        world. which  leads to the next point:

    - your localization does and will impact the indecies
        of the result set you get back, due to a number
        of variables that will cause the results in a
        given area to be tailored more towards their
        socio-economic(among other things...) norms.

    - clustering word and order matter. Thats kind of
        like the start of what I would call phrasing. I
        think what fravia is going for is your smallest
        unit is a word, the a group of related
        potentially words that's purmutable, then a
        phrase or tuple structure bound by semantics
        then the very fiber of truth you are
        searching for which is => the `concepts` of your query.

    - _closing with you are your own best friend and worst enemy along with a lecture of the stock pile of search results seekers can sometimes(or many times in a few unique cases) leave behind.
